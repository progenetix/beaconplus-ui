variantAlleleRequest:
  note: "Example for specific EIF4A1 mutation"
  label: "Allele Request"
  description: |
    The <i>Beacon Allele Request</i> corresponds to the original Beacon query, in which
    variants with a specific combination of reference and alternate bases are being
    matched. "N" here can stand in as wildcard nucleotide.

variantRangeRequest:
  note: ""
  label: "Range Query"
  description: |
    Range + wildcard query will return any variant between the given positions. Either a
    "variant type" or alternate bases ("N" for wildcard) should be specified.
    The exact variants which were being found can be retrieved through the variant
    handover [Hâ€”>O] link.
