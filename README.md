### Introduction

The [Beacon+](http://beacon.progenetix.org) **web-based user interface** originally was developed to implement the **BeaconCNVRequest** as described in [https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team/pull/94](https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team/pull/94)

Beacon+ now is a feature-extended, forward looking implementation of the [Beacon API](http://beacon-project.io), aimed at testing current features and roadmap items for the ELIXIR Beacon code development.

The Beacon+ queries are against genomic variant data and metadata annotations (biomedical, procedural) from the [Progenetix](http://progenetix.org) cancer genomics environment.

For more information, please see the [Beacon documentation on Progenetix](https://info.progenetix.org/tags/Beacon.html) and the [Beacon Project](http://beacon-project.io) website.
